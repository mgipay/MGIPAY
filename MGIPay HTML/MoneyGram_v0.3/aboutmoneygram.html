    <p><h1>Global Funds Transfer</h1>
    <p><h2>MoneyGram Money Transfer</h2>
    Our global money transfer service allows consumers to send and receive money worldwide, primarily through a global network of third-party agents that use our money transfer systems. In addition to person-to-person (also known as cash-to-cash), customers have alternatives in money transfer delivery channels such as direct-to-account, ATMs and kiosks for deposit and cash receive, cash-to-a mobile phone and cash-to-card.</p>
    <p>
    	MoneyGram’s partnership with PayPal extends this  service offering by allowing consumers to add cash to their own or someone else’s US PayPal account from selected locations and to withdraw cash from a US PayPal balance for collection at any of the 47,000 US MoneyGram locations.  Cash can be added or withdrawn within minutes.
    </p>
    
    <p><h2>MoneyGram Bill Payments Services</h2>
    Our bill payment services allow consumers to make urgent payments or pay routine bills through our network to certain creditors ("billers"). We maintain relationships with billers in key industries which include the credit card, mortgage, auto finance, telecommunications, corrections, satellite, prepaid card and collections industries. Bill payment services also enable consumers to load and reload prepaid debit cards.</p>
