The verification process will not occur until you request a Transfer. Once you have completed the application procedures, your use of the Service(s) may be subject to certain restrictions as disclosed to you in this Agreement or in another Communication from us. The restrictions will remain in effect until any verification of your address, identity, or PayPal Account required by MoneyGram has been successfully completed. Once your address, identity, and PayPal Account information have been successfully verified or authenticated by us, you may make use of the Service(s) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

You are responsible if MoneyGram makes a Transfer you request and, for any reason, MoneyGram is unable to collect the funds from your PayPal Account, or the Transfer is later reversed. In addition, MoneyGram's making of any Transfer without sufficient funds available or without PayPal’s approval shall not create any obligation on the part of MoneyGram to make any such Transfer now or in the future.

Except as required by law, MoneyGram will not be responsible or liable in any manner to you or any other person for its failure for any reason to cancel a Transfer.

								MoneyGram will use reasonable efforts to determine whether you are entitled to a refund and, if applicable effect a refund, within thirty (30) days after it receives from you a valid written request (including by email) or such shorter period as may be required by law. If MoneyGram determines that funds have not been delivered due solely to MoneyGram's or our Representative's fault, both the Transfer Amount and the Consumer Fee will be refunded in U.S. dollars. If MoneyGram determines that you are entitled to a refund for any other reason, only the Transfer Amount will be refunded.
